### what's this?
Doing Bad Things Poorly is my personal site and blog.

### what does "doing bad things poorly" mean?
Taking creative inspiration from [zhuowei's Worth Doing Badly](https://worthdoingbadly.com/about):

> If a thing is worth doing, it is worth doing badly. \
> — G. K. Chesterton

In the course of my writing, I hope to surface the absolute worst technical ideas and bring them to fruition, poorly.

### who is this clown?

I'm currently looking for internship or co-op opportunities related to computing for Summer 2021 and beyond. Like what you see? [Get in touch!](mailto:andrew@unown.me)
